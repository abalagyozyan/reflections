When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There may be many different instances when creating a remote repository can be useful, for example you may want to collaborate with others, or simply make the code open source, so that many people may contribute.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You don't want git to save every small and large change
